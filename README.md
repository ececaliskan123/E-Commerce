## Directory structure
For execution of all scripts, the working directory needs to be the project root!

`models/` for binary, saved models which can be loaded for inferring predictions

`data/` for CSVs, raw as well as preprocessed 

`submission_paper/` for the text files from which our paper submission will be generated
