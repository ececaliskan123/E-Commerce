## Directory structure

For execution of all scripts, the working directory needs to be the project root!

The directory is organized according to the structure of our written report in addition to some auxiliary folders (helpers, individual_submissions, old)

`base_modeling/` code for model construction with mlr 

`data/` for CSVs, results, raw as well as preprocessed, used in the report

`feature_engineering/` code related to feature engineering

`models/` for binary, saved models which can be loaded for inferring predictions

`post_processing/` additional results exclusively used for pst-processing

`stacking/` code for different stacking models we compared

## Thank you for a great course!
